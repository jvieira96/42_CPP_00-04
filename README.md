This repository contains my solutions for the 42 School C++ modules 00 to 04. These modules serve as an introduction to object-oriented programming in C++, covering fundamental concepts and laying the groundwork for more advanced topics.

## üìö Modules Overview

### CPP00 - Introduction to C++
- **Objective**: Understand the basics of C++ syntax and structure.
- **Key Concepts**: Variables, data types, input/output, control structures.

### CPP01 - Functions and Arrays
- **Objective**: Learn to work with functions and arrays in C++.
- **Key Concepts**: Function declarations, array manipulation, basic algorithms.

### CPP02 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Objective**: Dive into the principles of OOP.
- **Key Concepts**: Classes, objects, constructors, destructors, member functions.

### CPP03 - Inheritance and Polymorphism
- **Objective**: Explore inheritance and polymorphism in C++.
- **Key Concepts**: Base and derived classes, method overriding, virtual functions.

### CPP04 - Advanced OOP Concepts
- **Objective**: Master advanced OOP concepts.
- **Key Concepts**: Abstract classes, interfaces, deep copy constructors, assignment operators.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation & Execution

To compile and run the programs:
